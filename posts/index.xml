      <description>The aim of the project is to separate staff and student circulation.&#xA;The brief needed a primary school in Birkenhead, Merseyside capable of catering for six school years.&#xA;The main challenge was fitting the accommodation schedule on such a small site of 198 sq.m. The design approach was to create a mountain where the classrooms and additional accommodation was staggered around a central hall space. Access for students and parents would be externally through a terrace with staff entering through the main building itself.</description>

      <description>The aim of my project is to create a film hub on campus that links the south west side with current and future hotspots across the university.&#xA;It will be a mixed-use sustainable building that provides private and well thought out spaces for film teaching and development whilst also hosting public meeting areas and events.&#xA;The design is based around the relationship between the studio and cinema boxes. The workshops, control rooms and teaching spaces serve the studio space and there is a visual awareness between the production (studio) and viewing (cinema) Heat recovery and rainwater collection systems ensure the building is sustainable.</description>

      <description>The aim of the project is to create a mixed use building with clear boundaries between private and public spaces. The accommodation needed to house at least twenty residents including two accessible rooms. Other requirements included co-working, social, and recreation spaces. The residents I chose to cater for were young NHS workers stationed at the Royal and Womenâ€™s Hospitals in Liverpool. Public spaces include a gym and cafe with a social plaza that interacts with the street on the south of the site.</description>
